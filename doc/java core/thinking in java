Everything is an Object
manipulate Objects with references

reference
String a :create a reference
String a = new String("a"); create an object , and set the reference refers to the object

java storage
1.registers
2.stack
3.heap
4.constant storage
5.Non-RAM storage

primitive types:
new places objects in heap.
primitive tyoe value is not reference,the variable holds the value directly,and it's placed in stack,so it's much more efficient.
boolean
byte    16
char    8
short   16
int     32
long    64
float   32
double  64

wrapper type : allow to make no-primitive type objects in heap to represent that primitive tye values.

Arrays in java

scoping

the method name and the argument list are called method signature
