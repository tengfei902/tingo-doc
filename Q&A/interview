2.introduce your last project
Lufax Search engine is based on elasticsearch,used to provide services of full-text search and second level cache.
The elasticsearch servers are deploied on 4 servers, each server has 2 applications.Each node has 1 sharding and 3 replica.
The cluster is managed by zookepper.
The Es Service comprises server side and client side.
The server side connects to ES cluster,publishes restful interfaces to client side.
The client side is an SDK. users can use the SDK to manipulate ES just like database.

The ES service can be divided into several components.
first is es managing. we provides a list of annotations to define a bean index mapping. once the bean changed,the index
and type will adjust according to the change types of the bean.
second is data update, we provide an interface, contains the method updateById,updateRecent,updateAll.users can implement
the interface and filled with their own logics.
third is query service.We provide an interface with serial of query methods.and some assistance to accomplish the functional
programming.
the last is backgroup operation,such as keyword management,field weight in full-text searching,recommend list and so on.

The applications uses jersey to accomplish restful service,mybatis as orm mapping,spring to manage structures.
Database is oracle ,kafka and activeMq are used as message midware, files are now saved on disk, we may plan to transfer to
habse in the future.
